<h4>2.5 Schedule Analysis</h4>
<p>When the administrator clicks the <b>Analytics</b> menuitem, the screen seen in Figure 2.5-1 is displayed.</p>

<p>The administrator uses this screen to determine the quality of the current generated schedule. Overall quality statistics as well as the quality for each instructor is displayed. If an instructor's quality rating is lower or higher than one standard deviation away from the overall average, the respective row is highlighted in either green(higher) or red(lower).</p>
<p>The analytics above refer to the following schedule:</p>

<p>Although the overall schedule quality is fairly high, the scheduling administrator wants to fix some of the individual schedule qualities, most notably that of Clark Turner.</p>
<p>To do this, the administrator needs to change some preferences. He notices that John Dalbey has a fairly high schedule quality; some of his classes could be given to Professor Turner.<br />
Upon inspecting John Dalbey's preferences, the administrator notices that Professor Dalbey has a free schedule and prefers many classes.</p>

</div>
<p>When the administrator checks Clark Turner's preferences, he notices that Professor Turner can only work Tuesdays and Thursdays and is only qualified to teach 308 and 309 (and he greatly enjoys teaching them).</p>

    <p class="caption">Figure 2.5-4: Clark Turner's current preferences</p>
</div>
<p>The administrator realizes that this is the reason Professor Turner isn't getting the classes he wants and proceeds to modify John Dalbey's preferences by disqualifying him for 308 and 309 and not having him work Tuesdays and Thursdays. This should balance out the schedule.</p>

<p>The administrator now generates a new schedule and heads back to analytics to see if anything has changed.</p>

</div>
<p>There are more reds and greens, but overall statistics got better. Most notably, the standard deviation got smaller. This made more colors appear, but each teacher is fairly close to the average.<br />
    The administrator realizes that he achieved his goal of increasign Clark Turner's quality, bringing Professor Turner's quality from 30% to 65%. As predicted, most of that percentage came from taking classes from Professor Dalbey, as his quality went down 12%.</p>
<p>
    More small tweaks and fine tuning like this lead to a high quality schedule.
