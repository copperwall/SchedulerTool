Questions:
<br>
1. You mentioned that we shouldn't have admin accounts. We were thinking of everyone logging in as either a student, teacher or admin. Is this acceptable or would you prefer something else? Should there be public access?
<br>
- Ok to have admin
<br>
- Add public catagory
<br>
<br>
2. What constraints do you absolutely need to create a schedule?
<br>
- Overlapping rooms
<br>
- Instructor in two places at once
<br>
- Overriding units
<br>
<br>
3. Are there any other constraints you would like but are not neccessary?
<br>
- teacher preference
<br>
- student preference
<br>
- equipment
<br>
- proximity by room
<br>
- lab/lecture adjacency
<br>
<br>
4. Do we have to archive past schedules too or are we only archiving the schedules that we generate?
<br>
<br>
5. Does an archive feature imply that we need an import/export feature?
<br>
<br>
6. Is there an accessible archive?
<br>
<br>
7. How do you deal with the issue of teachers teaching multiple sections of the same class at once?
<br>
- Define a distinct vs. grouped sections. Must be in a separate room.
<br>
<br>
8. Do we need to take into account whether a classroom has the right equipment for the class?
<br>
<br>
9. How many schedules in advance can students see?
<br>
<br>
10. Would you prefer a desktop application or a web based application?
<br>
<br>
11. What's your favorite color?
<br>
