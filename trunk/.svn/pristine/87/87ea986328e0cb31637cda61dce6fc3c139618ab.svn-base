<h4>1.4 Impacts</h4>
<p>The positive potential impacts of the Scheduler tool are creating a system that schedules classes efficiently into rooms across campus, without the hassle of scheduling all classes manually. The positive impacts of the Scheduler are having a dedicated system to generate schedules which will make it easy for everyone else.</p>

<p>Scheduler, like any other software program, can cause negative impacts. When the administrator generates a schedule, it may take too long for him/her. If the administrator is on a tight deadline to create a scheduler and it takes 3 hours to generate a schedule, he/she will not be happy. If it isn't implemented correctly and the scheduler algorithm doesn't always work, it will cause frustration to our customers and decrease productivity. It's possible that the scheduler could include two classes in the same room, which will cause chaos when these classes discover this. It's also possible that the schedule will not meet the needs for every instructor. Some of their preferences may not be compliable with the generated schedule; this will not make the happy. The whole campus will rely on this system and it can't be messed up. Significant frustration will occur to the customers if there is data loss.</p>
