<p>On the left, the instructor may edit their available times, and on the right, his or her course preferences. Any time the instructor makes a change, it is immediately updated in the database and will be automatically updated in the administrative application.</p>
<p>To mark times as available, the instructor clicks and drags sections of time. For example, if an instructor is available from 9am to 3pm on Mondays and Fridays and from 9am to 6pm on Wednesdays, the instructor clicks and drags from the 9am box to the 3pm box on the Monday and Friday columns and from the 9am box to the 6pm box on the Wednesday column.<br /><br />
    An instructor indicates their course preferences by clicking one of the six radio buttons next to the course name. The farthest left one signifies that the instructor is not qualified to teach the course and the other five represent increasing levels of preference going rightward.
