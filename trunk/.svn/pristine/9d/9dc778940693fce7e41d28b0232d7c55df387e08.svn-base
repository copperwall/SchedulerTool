    <p class="caption">Figure 2.2-1: The Authentication Popup</p>
</div>
<p>The authentication popup is fairly straightforward. It contains a form with two fields: 'Username' and 'Password'.<br />
    These fields are to be filled with the user's Cal Poly authentication credentials; 'Username' is the user's Cal Poly user id, and 'Password' is the user's Cal Poly Portal password.<br />
    At the bottom of the form is a 'Submit' button.<br />
    When the user clicks this button, his/her entered credentials are authenticated against Cal Poly's Active Directory.<br />
    <ol class="inner_list">If the authentication is <b>successful</b>:
        <li>the user's type (Student/Instructor) is determined based on flags in the database.</li>
        <li>based on the user's type, the interface changes. Details on these changes can be found in the "Main View" sections of this document.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="inner_list">If the authentication is <b>unsuccessful</b>:
        <li>the user is notified of the authentication failure in the auth popup and is allowed to try again.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
