<h4>1.2 System Personnel</h4>
<ol class="inner_list lower_letter_list">The personnel involved in the Scheduling Tool project are organized into the following groups and subgroups:
    <li>end users</li>
    <ol class="inner_list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman; padding-left: 3em;">
        <li>students</li>
        <li>teachers</li>
        <li>scheduling administrators</li>
        <li>unregistered individual users</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<p>End users are those who use the Scheduler for its intended purpose. Students can vote for upcomming courses, providing preference input for the scheduling algorithm. Teachers can set availibility and class preferences, providing soft constraints for the scheduling algorithm. Scheduling Administrators perform overall system administration functions, including generating schedules and manually overriding generated schedules. Finally, anyone can view previously generated schedules from the Scheduler as an unregistered user.</p>
<p>The primary customer is the Computer Science department at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. In this representative capacity, our team will consult with other students and teachers to gather requirements from them, and integrate their requirements within the scheduler.</p>
<p>The primary system developers are Katie Keim, Chase Kragenbrink, Alex Kavanaugh, Calvin Elizan, Jarred Stelfox, Chris Opperwal. Our team's development activities are all those of the software development process, from requirements analysis through product implementation and deployment. We will also conduct the ongoing process activities of testing, configuration, documentation, and project management. As noted above, the Scheduler is intended to serve as an eventual replacement to the current way (manually) of scheduling classes.</p>
