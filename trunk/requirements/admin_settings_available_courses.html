</div>
<p>The above schedule (Figure 2.4.3-2) shows a section of CPE 102. If the admin does not want any sections of CPE 102 in this term, they go to the Available Courses dialog.</p>

</div>
<p>The administrator reaches the Available Courses page by clicking the <b>Available Courses</b> item under the <b>Settings</b> menu. The system then shows the Available Courses dialog shown above (Figure 2.4.3-2). The administrator uses this screen to set the amount of sections they want for each course in the current term. This page shows a list of courses currently listed in the courses database. As a default, the program sets a newly added course to 0 sections. The administrator can change the number of sections for each course by simply clicking the appropriate box and editing the number within. A section count of 0 means the course will not be incorporated into the generated schedule. The 'Suggested Sections' column contains the values calculated from student votes. The administrator has the option to automatically populate section counts based on past terms or on student demand via the buttons at the bottom of the page. The <b>Load From</b> button loads section counts from previous terms, while the <b>Load Suggested</b> button loads section counts from the 'Suggested Sections' column. In this screen the admin sees that the system is set to generate 6 sections of CPE 102.</p>

    <p class='caption'>Figure 2.4.3-3: The available courses page with no 102.</p>
</div>

<p>Since the admin does not want CPE 102 taught this term, they set the number of sections of 102 to 0 as shown above (Figure 2.4.3-3).</p>

</div>

<p>Now the admin clicks <b>Generate</b> again, and the system creates a schedule with no CPE 102 sections such as in the schedule above (Figure 2.4.3-4).</p>
