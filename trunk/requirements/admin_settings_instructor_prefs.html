</div>

<p>The admin clicks the <b>Instructor Preferences</b> button under the <b>Settings</b> menu, and the system shows the Admin Instructor Preferences dialog (Figure 2.4.2-2). This page allows an administrator to modify the time or course preferences of any instructor. To edit an instructor's preferences (availability per day/hour and classes willing to teach), the administrator selects the instructor from the list on the left and then modifies the preferences that show up on the right. The checkbox on the bottom right of the screen allows the administrator to lock the selected instructor's preferences so that only the administrator may edit them. In this screen (Figure 2.4.2-2) the admin sees that Paul Hatalsky has set some unreasonable course and time preferences.</p>

<p>The admin wants to fill in the STAFF spot with Paul Hatalsky, so they click and drag the available times for Paul Hatalsky to be more reasonable and set some high course preferences. The admin also locks these preferences for Paul Hatalsky for the current term by checking the box at the bottom of the screen. Paul Hatalsky's preferences aren't changed permantly, but for this term Paul Hatalsky's preferences remain as the admin sets them as long as they are locked. The modified instructor preferences are shown in the screen above (Figure 2.4.2-3).</p>

</div>

<p>Now the admin generates the schedule again and voila! Paul Hatalsky is now teaching CSC 225 as in the schedule above (Figure 2.4.2-4).</p>
