<h4>1.1 Problem Statement</h4>
<ol class="inner_list lower_letter_list">The general problems to be addressed by the Scheduler Tool project are the following:
    <li>to provide an easy and automated tool to generate quality course schedules</li>
    <li>to provide a scheduling algorithm that considers multiple hard and soft constraints, and attempts to accomodate the maximum number of soft constraints</li>
    <li>to provide a means to manage databases for course, instructor, and room information for scheduling purposes.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="inner_list lower_letter_list">While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and public domain products, the Scheduler provides a solution with certain functional improvements over existing tools. Specific problem areas are the following:
    <li>factoring in faculty preferences, such as course or time, into schedule generation</li>
    <li>allowing registered students to vote for courses in future schedules</li>
    <li>one-click schedule generation</li>
    <li>a scheduling algorithm custom-tailored to the customer's institution and department scheduling policies and requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>The Scheduler project addresses the requirements of a particular customer. This customer needs a tool with a collection of features not available in any single existing tool. This aspect of the problem is one of combining a set of existing features in a way that the features have yet to be combined in another product.</p>
<ol class="inner_list lower_letter_list">In addition, the development of functioning software, the Scheduling Tool project focuses on three additional problems not addressed in commercial tools: 
    <li>to provide a pedagogical example for use in the instruction of software engineering, including an example of the practical application of formal methods</li>
    <li>to provide fully documented, public domain source code for use by others</li>
    <li>to provide easily-accessible documentation for users</li>
</ol>
