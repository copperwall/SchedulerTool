<h4>1 Introduction</h4>
<p>This document defines requirements for an electronic scheduler. The tool provides functions to generate a schedule of classes for university departments, and individuals can log on to the scheduler as either a student, teacher, or an administrator. The tool takes into account student and teacher class preferences, teacher availabilty, location, and units per course. Administrators use their own settings to then generate a department schedule for one quarter at a time. Future schedules can be made which are also available for the public to see. </p>
<p>In addition to providing useful functionality, the scheduler serves as an example of software engineering concepts and principles. The software development artifacts for the scheduler are considered part of the overall scheduler package.</p>
