<h4>1.5.4 Related Systems: RosterBooster</h4>
<p><i>RosterBooster</i> is a Windows application with its own algorithm to "solve" a roster for shifts at a workplace. The software available is test-only, therefore, features are limited. There are examples of rosters in which you can hit <b>Solve</b> and set a time limit, a maximum allotted memory, and others. It's a simple program but the UI isn't the best looking. It's difficult to manage everything and it's easy to get lost. Preferences are very user-unfriendly and it doesn't seem like anyone would use this.</p>

<ul class="inner_list"><b>Good Features:</b>
    <li>Customizable algorithm parameters.</li>
