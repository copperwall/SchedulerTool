The three core features the scheduling tool improves on, in relation to these systems, are as follows:
    <li>streamlined automatic generation of schedules based on hard and soft constraints</li>
    <li>simpler, more straightforward methods for end users to input preferences (soft constraints)</li>
    <li>more natural interface for manually editing generated schedules</li>
