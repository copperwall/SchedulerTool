<h4>1.3 Operational Setting</h4>
<p>There are two operational settings for the Scheduler Tool: (1) normal use as a functioning software system; (2) use as an example in software engineering courses.</p>
<p>The Scheduler Tool must be installed in California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo where class schedules must be generated according to room and professor availability and other Cal Poly-specific restrictions such as having classes only take place on certain patterns of days.</p>
<p>As noted in the preceding section on system personnel, the primary customer is the Computer Science department at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. As such, the tool's requirements reflect the point of view of the customer base, including their work setting. However, the scheduling processes of the other Cal Poly departments and other universities or organizations that do similar scheduling will be considered if they have the potential to improve scheduling.</p>
<p>For use as a pedagogical example, the Scheduler Tool has been designed to fit the curriculum used by Gene Fisher in undergraduate and graduate software engineering courses at Cal Poly University. These courses are two-quarter sequences that cover standard aspects of software engineering, with emphasis on the practical application of formal methods. For the most part, the concepts covered in these courses, and hence the concepts embodied in the Scheduler Tool, are mainstream software engineering. Other instructors may therefore find the Scheduler Tool and its development artifacts useful as course examples.</p>
