<h4>2.7.3 Student View</h4>
<p>When a user clicks the Voting button toward the top of the page, the following page appears.</p>
<p>Depending on whether the voting window is open or closed, this page either allows students to vote on classes they would like to take for a particular term or allows students to view their vote. Each vote has a course and department drop-down. After making their selections, students submit their votes via the <b>Submit</b> button. Once a student clicks either the <b>Submit</b> or <b>Cancel</b> button, the scheduler application returns to its main view.</p>
