<p><i>OptaPlanner</i> is an open source suite of backtracking algorithms. The GUI it ships with is filled with examples, most notably a testing scheduler and a nurse roster generator. Its major selling point is its open source algorithms. With these customizable algorithms already in place, developers can focus more on the front-end interface.</p>
<p>Although OptaPlanner boasts an excellent selection of algorithms, it has no true front end, and the source code is extremely diffucult to follow.</p>
