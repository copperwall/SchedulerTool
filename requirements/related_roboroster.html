<h4>1.5.3 Related Systems: RoboRoster</h4>
<p>Like FindMyShift, <i>RoboRoster</i> is an online scheduling application. Unlike FindMyShift, this is packed full of features and has a friendly, simple, and powerful user interface.</p>
<p>RoboRoster contains almost all the features the Scheduling Tool offers and more. For the goals of the scheduling tool, however, most of these features are unnecessary. Implementing these features would complicate the scheduling tool, making it more difficult to use.</p>
