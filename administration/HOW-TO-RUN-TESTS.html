Go to testing/implementation/scheduler_tool/ and run Scheduler-M5-Tests.jar

Unfortunately, the file can't be run without eclipse, due to classpath problems
with JUnit 4.

To run, open in eclipse, right click and click Run As.., then click java
application, Desktop Main, and set the main class to scheduler_tool.RunTests
